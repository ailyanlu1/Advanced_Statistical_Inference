## Evaluating Estimators

* **Sufficiency Principle**: Read about [Minimal Sufficient Statistic](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~larry/=stat705/Lecture5.pdf) here.
* **Factorization Theorem**: Read an introduction to [factorization theorem](https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat414/node/283) here. It also has examples for finding sufficient statistic for Poisson, Normal and Exponential distributions.
