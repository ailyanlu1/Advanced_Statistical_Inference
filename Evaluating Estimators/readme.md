## Evaluating Estimators

* **Sufficiency Principle**: [Principle of Data Reduction](http://www.math.ntu.edu.tw/~hchen/teaching/StatInference/notes/ch6.pdf) is the foundation for **sufficient statistic**. It also develops a background on **Complete Statistic**, **Equivariance Principle** and **Likelihood Principle**.Read more about [Minimal Sufficient Statistic](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~larry/=stat705/Lecture5.pdf) here.
* **Factorization Theorem**: Read an introduction to [factorization theorem](https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat414/node/283) here. It also has examples for finding sufficient statistic for Poisson, Normal and Exponential distributions.
