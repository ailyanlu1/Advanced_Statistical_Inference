## Evaluating Estimators

Continuing with a general background introduced in [estimation theory](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~liam/teaching/4107-fall05/notes3.pdf)


* **Sufficiency Principle**: [Principle of Data Reduction](http://www.math.ntu.edu.tw/~hchen/teaching/StatInference/notes/ch6.pdf) is the foundation for **sufficient statistic**. It also develops a background on **Complete Statistic**, **Equivariance Principle** and **Likelihood Principle**.Read more about [Minimal Sufficient Statistic](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~larry/=stat705/Lecture5.pdf) here.
* **Factorization Theorem**: Read an introduction to [factorization theorem](https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat414/node/283) here. It also has examples for finding sufficient statistic for Poisson, Normal and Exponential distributions.
* **Multidimensional Sufficient Statistic**: Read about [multidimensional sufficient statistic](http://www.math.ntu.edu.tw/~hchen/teaching/StatInference/notes/ch6.pdf) which are part of [Information Processing and Learning](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aarti/Class/10704_Spring15/) course at CMU CS department whose lectures can be accesed [here](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aarti/Class/10704_Spring15/lecs.html).
