#### Explaining the situation
We've moved from the realm of probability to statistics where we have unknown population i.e. all we know is that we have data and statistics computed from the data. Our objective is to estimate the sampling distribution of statistic.

#### What is Bootstrap technique?
Bootstrap is a technique that uses the ***given sample as the population*** (from which this sample is drawn) and creates a new distribution called ***Bootstrap Distribution***. This bootstrap distribution is then used for ***approximating the sampling distribution of mean (or other statistics).***
