a) Introduction-http://www.personal.soton.ac.uk/jav/soton/HELM/workbooks/workbook_37/37_4_hypergeometric_dist.pdf       
b) Deriving the formula for E(X) and Var(X), where X is a Hypergeometric random variable and On the proof of the "Binomial Distribution as a Limit of Hypergeometric Distributions" - http://faculty.washington.edu/fm1/394/Materials/Hypergeometric.pdf 

c) 




## Exponential Distribution
a) Introduction-

b) Deriving the E(X) and Var(X) where X follows exponential distribution- https://math.berkeley.edu/~scanlon/m16bs04/ln/16b2lec31.pdf (Please note that for deriving E(X), concepts should be clear about Integration by parts. Read about it here: https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~kouba/CalcTwoDIRECTORY/intbypartsdirectory/IntByParts.html) -
